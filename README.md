# hiremeanywhere

✨Inspiration✨
We wanted to help female college graduates find jobs by providing them with free and easy-to-use resources.

✨What it does✨
HireMeAnywhere has three features including a resume builder, portfolio templates, and mentorship opportunities. The Resume Builder feature allows you to build a resume by providing skills and experiences. It then takes the information provided and generates a resume starter for the user to download. The Build Your Portfolio section gives the user templets for building their own portfolio website. This section also provides tips and more information about what a portfolio is, how to build one, and why a portfolio is important. The Mock Interview feature allows users to complete a form which applies them to recieve mentorship towards finding a job. These mentors will provide tips and tricks for interviewing and will also host mock interviews with their mentee. We also included a feature that allows people to apply to become a mentor.
